# HTTP Concurrent Fetching Library Requirements

## Purpose
This library provides a high-performance, concurrent HTTP request handling system built in Go. It implements a thread pool pattern to efficiently manage multiple HTTP requests simultaneously, making it ideal for applications that need to fetch data from multiple APIs or endpoints concurrently. The library features configurable worker pools, timeout handling, and structured response management.

## Core Features
- Concurrent HTTP request processing with configurable worker pools
- Automatic timeout handling (5-second default)
- Structured response data with status codes and error handling
- Thread-safe job distribution and result collection
- Graceful worker termination and resource cleanup

## Dependencies
- Go 1.23.4 or higher
- Standard library packages: net/http, io, time, errors, fmt
- No external dependencies required

## Usage Example
```go
// Create HTTP request attempts
attempts := []*fetching.FetchingAttempt{
    fetching.NewfetchingAttempt("https://api.example.com/data1", "GET", 1),
    fetching.NewfetchingAttempt("https://api.example.com/data2", "GET", 2),
}

// Create thread pool with 2 workers
threadPool, _ := fetching.NewFetchingThreadPool(attempts, 2)

// Execute all requests concurrently
responses := threadPool.FetchData()
```

## Performance Benefits
- Reduces total request time by processing multiple requests in parallel
- Configurable worker count allows optimization for different use cases
- Efficient resource utilization with buffered channels
- Minimal memory overhead with structured data handling
